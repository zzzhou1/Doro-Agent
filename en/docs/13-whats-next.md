## What We Didn't Implement

### Hooks (Hook System)

Claude Code has 25 hook events and 6 hook types, allowing custom logic to be inserted before and after tool execution -- intercepting dangerous operations, recording audit logs, automatically running lint checks. It's the key mechanism that transforms Claude Code from a "tool" into a "platform."

Why we didn't implement it: The core challenge isn't "calling a function" but hook discovery and loading, error isolation, and the stdin/stdout JSON data protocol. These engineering details amount to about 500-800 lines but don't help with understanding agent principles.

### Coordinator / Swarm Multi-Agent Modes

We implemented Sub-Agent (fork-return). Claude Code has two additional modes: **Coordinator** breaks large tasks into pieces for multiple specialized Agents, and **Swarm** allows multiple Agents to communicate as peers and explore in parallel. Both modes solve the task decomposition problem when a single Agent's context isn't enough.

Why we didn't implement them: The core challenge is task decomposition accuracy and inter-Agent communication protocol design -- more of a prompt engineering problem than a code architecture problem. The implementation itself isn't complex, but making it truly useful requires extensive prompt tuning.

### LSP Integration

LSP gives the agent millisecond-level type error feedback after editing files, without waiting for a full compile/test cycle. In large projects, this can reduce the number of iterations needed to fix a bug by 30-50%.

Why we didn't implement it: Requires managing LSP server processes, implementing the client protocol (initialization handshake, capability negotiation, incremental sync) -- 1000+ lines and depends on deep understanding of the LSP protocol. Getting error feedback through shell commands (`tsc --noEmit`, `python -m py_compile`) is sufficient for tutorial scenarios.

### Prompt Caching

The Anthropic API supports caching system prompts -- Claude Code puts the unchanging parts (role definition, tool specs) first and the changing parts (git status, current file) last. Cache hits can reduce input token cost by 90%.

Why we didn't implement it: The code change is minimal (20-30 lines), but requires careful design of the prompt partitioning strategy. If your agent is going to production, this should be the first optimization you add.

### Bash AST Security Analysis

Claude Code uses tree-sitter to parse shell command ASTs, performing 23 static security checks that can analyze dangerous commands within pipe combinations -- something pure regex can't do.

Why we didn't implement it: tree-sitter is a native C/C++ library requiring a `node-gyp` build environment, creating too high an environmental barrier. Regex matching covers 80% of common dangerous patterns, and the risk is acceptable for tutorial scenarios.

## Progressive Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Performance and Cost Optimization (1-2 days)

| Enhancement | Problem Solved | Estimated Code |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Prompt Caching | Wasted tokens resending system prompt | ~30 lines |

**Prompt Caching** is the optimization with the best return on investment: add `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` markers to the static portions of the system prompt, saving 50%+ input token cost across multi-turn conversations.

### Phase 2: Extensibility (3-5 days)

| Enhancement | Problem Solved | Estimated Code |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Hook system | Customizing agent behavior requires modifying source code | ~300 lines |
| Tool type system | switch/case doesn't scale to 20+ tools | ~200 lines |

The core transition is **from hardcoded to plugin-based**. The current switch/case works fine at 10 tools, but beyond 20 you need to introduce a Tool interface (or Python's Protocol/ABC), making each tool an independent module.

### Phase 3: Reliability and Security (1-2 weeks)

| Enhancement | Problem Solved | Estimated Code |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 7 error recovery strategies | Currently crashes on errors | ~400 lines |
| Bash AST security analysis | Regex misses complex dangerous commands | ~600 lines |

Claude Code's `query.ts` has 1728 lines, most of which handle edge cases: auto-compress and retry on Prompt Too Long, exponential backoff on API overload, feed tool failures back to the model so it can self-repair.

### Phase 4: Advanced Agent Capabilities (2-4 weeks)

| Enhancement | Problem Solved | Estimated Code |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Coordinator mode | Large tasks exceed single Agent context capacity | ~500 lines |
| Swarm mode | Exploratory tasks need multi-path parallelism | ~600 lines |
| LSP integration | Type errors can only be found through compilation | ~1000 lines |

## Extension Directions

### 1. Hooks System

The simplest approach is command hooks -- spawn a shell child process before `executeTool`, pass tool information via stdin JSON, and parse stdout JSON to decide allow/deny.

Configuration example:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "run_shell", "command": "./hooks/pre-shell.sh" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Core logic: iterate over matching hooks, spawn child processes passing JSON, and decide whether to continue execution based on `{"action": "allow"}` / `{"action": "deny", "reason": "..."}`. About 300 lines; the most time-consuming part is handling child process timeouts and crashes.

### 2. Error Self-Repair

Feed tool execution errors back to the model as tool results instead of breaking the loop. The model can often self-repair: wrong path, try a different path; wrong command arguments, fix the arguments.

```typescript
try {
  result = await executeToolImpl(name, input);
} catch (e) {
  result = `Error: ${e.message}\n\nPlease try a different approach.`;
}
// Return result as tool_result to the model
```

About 50-80 lines, but significantly improves the agent's real-world usability -- this is one of Claude Code's smartest designs.

## Core Insights

**1. An Agent is essentially a while loop**

```
while true:
    response = llm.call(messages)
    if no tool_calls in response: break
    for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
        result = execute(tool_call)
        messages.append(result)
```

All the complexity -- permissions, context management, memory, multi-agent -- is enhancement and protection built around this loop.

**2. Prompts are the cheapest code**

A single sentence in the system prompt has the same effect as an if statement, with an implementation cost of 0 lines of code. In agent development, the optimal solution for many behavioral issues isn't writing more code but writing better prompts -- more flexible, easier to modify, and readable by non-technical people.

**3. Tool design determines the capability ceiling**

Let the model do what it's good at (understanding intent, generating code), and let tools do what the model isn't good at (exact string matching, filesystem operations, process management). `edit_file` is the classic example: the model generates the content to replace, and the tool handles precisely locating and replacing it in the file.

**4. Context management is the agent's "memory"**

Context management is to an agent what memory management is to an operating system -- using limited resources to provide the illusion of "infinite." The 4-layer compression pipeline lets the agent maintain memory of long conversations within a finite window.

**5. Security is not an afterthought**

Permission checking is a step in the agent loop, not a bolted-on middleware. No tool can bypass it. More importantly, it uses a fail-closed design: if a new tool forgets to declare its permission level, it's automatically treated as "requires confirmation" -- the system guarantees safety through defaults.

**6. The gap from 3,000 lines to 500,000 lines is edge cases**

Most of Claude Code's additional code handles: cross-environment compatibility, network and API unreliability, user input diversity, enterprise-grade auditing and access control. These "boring" pieces of code don't appear in architecture diagrams, yet they're the key to whether a tool can run reliably in the real world. From prototype to product, 80% of the distance is here.

**7. The collaboration boundary between LLM and code**

The most essential skill in building a coding agent: designing the right collaboration boundary between the LLM and code. What does the LLM decide, and what does the code decide? When the boundary is well-drawn, the agent is both flexible and reliable. Every design decision in this tutorial reflects this principle: the model decides "what to do," and the code ensures "it's done safely."

## Conclusion

~4300 lines of code (TS) / ~3800 lines (Python), 12 files, covering the core components and advanced capabilities of a coding agent:

**Phase 1 -- Core Components:** Agent Loop, Tool System (13 tools + mtime protection + lazy loading + parallel execution), System Prompt (Markdown template + @include + environment injection), CLI / Session (REPL + JSON persistence), Streaming Output (Anthropic + OpenAI dual backend + streaming tool execution), Permission Security (5 modes + declarative rules + regex + confirmation), Context Management (4-layer compression + large result persistence)

**Phase 2 -- Advanced Capabilities:** Memory System (semantic recall + async prefetch), Skills System (inline/fork dual mode), Plan Mode (read-only planning + 4-option approval), Multi-Agent (Sub-Agent + 3 built-in types + custom), MCP Integration (JSON-RPC over stdio), Budget Control

A huge amount of the code in Claude Code's 500,000 lines is edge case handling and enterprise-grade reliability. But the core agent capabilities -- understand user intent -> call tools to manipulate code -> iterate until complete -- are exactly what these ~3400 lines do.

Now you have a feature-rich coding agent, and you understand the design intent behind every line of code. Go extend it.
