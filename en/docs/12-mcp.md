# 12. MCP Integration

## Chapter Goals

Enable the Agent to dynamically load external tools -- connect to databases, Slack, GitHub, and other services by simply declaring a server address, without modifying source code.

```

Core idea: **spawn child process -> JSON-RPC handshake -> discover tools -> register with prefix -> transparent routing**. From the Agent Loop's perspective, MCP tools and built-in tools are indistinguishable -- they're all name + schema + execution function.

## How Claude Code Does It

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol released by Anthropic for connecting AI assistants to external tools. Key aspects of Claude Code's MCP implementation:

**Configuration discovery**: Reads server configuration from three locations -- `settings.json` (user-level and project-level) and `.mcp.json` (project root), with later reads overriding earlier ones. Enterprise deployments also support MDM policy distribution.

**Transport protocols**: Supports two transport methods -- stdio (child process communication) and SSE (HTTP long-polling). stdio is the mainstream choice; SSE is used for remote services.

**Tool naming**: All MCP tools are registered in `mcp__serverName__toolName` format. This three-segment naming scheme simultaneously solves naming conflicts and routing -- you can tell from the name alone which server to forward to.

**Connection lifecycle**: spawn process -> `initialize` handshake (exchange version and capabilities) -> `notifications/initialized` confirmation -> `tools/list` tool discovery -> ready. Both initialization and tool discovery have 15-second timeouts.

**Dynamic refresh**: Claude Code supports runtime tool re-discovery (servers can notify the client that the tool list has changed); we simplify to one-time discovery.

**SDK dependency**: Claude Code uses the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` built-in MCP client, which wraps JSON-RPC details. We implement raw JSON-RPC directly, with no MCP SDK dependency.

## Configuration Format

Users only need to declare MCP servers in a configuration file, and the Agent connects automatically on startup:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json (user-level) or .claude/settings.json (project-level)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use `.mcp.json` in the project root, with the same format. Servers from all three configuration sources are merged and connected together; same-name servers are overridden by later reads.

## Our Implementation

A complete MCP client in **~266 lines** of `mcp.ts`, with zero SDK dependencies.

| Claude Code | Our Implementation | Simplification Reason |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` MCP client | Raw JSON-RPC (~100 lines) | No SDK dependency; readers can see protocol details |
| stdio + SSE transports | stdio only | stdio covers 95% of scenarios |
| Dynamic tool refresh | One-time discovery | Tutorial scenarios don't need hot reloading |
| Enterprise policy + 3 config sources | settings.json + .mcp.json | Removed enterprise-level config |
| Retry + fallback | Silently skip failed servers | Simplified error handling |

## Key Code

### 1. MCP Connection -- `McpConnection` Class

Each MCP server corresponds to one `McpConnection` instance, responsible for child process management and JSON-RPC communication.

```typescript
class McpConnection {
  private process: ChildProcess | null = null;
  private nextId = 1;
  private pending = new Map<number, { resolve: (v: any) => void; reject: (e: Error) => void }>();
  private rl: Interface | null = null;

  constructor(private serverName: string, private config: McpServerConfig) {}
```

Three key states: `process` is the child process handle, `pending` is the request-response correlation map (id -> Promise), and `rl` is the readline instance for line-by-line JSON-RPC parsing.

#### Connection and Message Parsing

```typescript
  async connect(): Promise<void> {
    const env = { ...process.env, ...(this.config.env || {}) };
    this.process = spawn(this.config.command, this.config.args || [], {
      stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "pipe"],
      env,
    });

    // Parse JSON-RPC messages line by line from stdout
    this.rl = createInterface({ input: this.process.stdout! });
    this.rl.on("line", (line: string) => {
      try {
        const msg = JSON.parse(line);
        if (msg.id !== undefined && this.pending.has(msg.id)) {
          const { resolve, reject } = this.pending.get(msg.id)!;
          this.pending.delete(msg.id);
          if (msg.error) {
            reject(new Error(`MCP error ${msg.error.code}: ${msg.error.message}`));
          } else {
            resolve(msg.result);
          }
        }
      } catch {
        // Ignore non-JSON lines (server logs, etc.)
      }
    });
  }
```

The core of stdio mode: the child process's stdin/stdout serve as a bidirectional communication channel, with one JSON-RPC message per line. The `pending` Map uses auto-incrementing ids to correlate requests and responses -- a Promise is stored when sending, then resolved or rejected when the response arrives.

#### Requests and Notifications

JSON-RPC has two message types: **requests** (have an id, expect a response) and **notifications** (no id, fire and forget).

```typescript
  /** Send a request and wait for a response */
  private sendRequest(method: string, params: any = {}): Promise<any> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (!this.process?.stdin?.writable) {
        return reject(new Error(`MCP server '${this.serverName}' is not connected`));
      }
      const id = this.nextId++;
      this.pending.set(id, { resolve, reject });
      const msg = JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc: "2.0", id, method, params }) + "\n";
      this.process.stdin.write(msg);
    });
  }

  /** Send a notification, don't wait for a response */
  private sendNotification(method: string, params: any = {}): void {
    if (!this.process?.stdin?.writable) return;
    const msg = JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc: "2.0", method, params }) + "\n";
    this.process.stdin.write(msg);
  }
```

The only difference is the presence or absence of the `id` field. Messages with an `id` are stored in `pending` waiting for a match; messages without an `id` are simply written to stdin and done.

#### Handshake, Discovery, and Invocation

```typescript
  /** MCP initialization handshake */
  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    await this.sendRequest("initialize", {
      protocolVersion: "2024-11-05",
      capabilities: {},
      clientInfo: { name: "mini-claude", version: "1.0.0" },
    });
    // Send notification to confirm after successful handshake
    this.sendNotification("notifications/initialized");
  }

  /** Discover tools provided by the server */
  async listTools(): Promise<McpToolInfo[]> {
    const result = await this.sendRequest("tools/list");
    if (!result?.tools || !Array.isArray(result.tools)) return [];
    return result.tools.map((t: any) => ({
      name: t.name,
      description: t.description || "",
      inputSchema: t.inputSchema,
      serverName: this.serverName,
    }));
  }

  /** Call a tool and return the text result */
  async callTool(name: string, args: any): Promise<string> {
    const result = await this.sendRequest("tools/call", { name, arguments: args });
    if (result?.content && Array.isArray(result.content)) {
      return result.content
        .filter((c: any) => c.type === "text")
        .map((c: any) => c.text)
        .join("\n");
    }
    return JSON.stringify(result);
  }
```

Three-step standard flow: `initialize` (version negotiation) -> `listTools` (tool discovery) -> `callTool` (execute calls). The MCP protocol requires sending a `notifications/initialized` notification after `initialize` to tell the server that the client is ready.

The return value handling in `callTool` is worth noting: MCP returns `{ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] }` format, and we only extract `text`-type content and concatenate it -- other types like images are not processed for now.

### 2. MCP Manager -- `McpManager` Class

Manages the lifecycle of all MCP connections, providing a unified interface.

#### Configuration Loading

```typescript
export class McpManager {
  private connections = new Map<string, McpConnection>();
  private tools: McpToolInfo[] = [];
  private connected = false;

  private loadConfigs(): Record<string, McpServerConfig> {
    const merged: Record<string, McpServerConfig> = {};

    // 1. User-level: ~/.claude/settings.json
    const globalPath = join(homedir(), ".claude", "settings.json");
    this.mergeConfigFile(globalPath, merged);

    // 2. Project-level: .claude/settings.json
    const projectPath = join(process.cwd(), ".claude", "settings.json");
    this.mergeConfigFile(projectPath, merged);

    // 3. MCP-specific: .mcp.json
    const mcpJsonPath = join(process.cwd(), ".mcp.json");
    this.mergeConfigFile(mcpJsonPath, merged);

    return merged;
  }

  private mergeConfigFile(filePath: string, target: Record<string, McpServerConfig>): void {
    if (!existsSync(filePath)) return;
    try {
      const raw = JSON.parse(readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8"));
      const servers = raw.mcpServers || raw;  // .mcp.json may be a flat server mapping
      for (const [name, config] of Object.entries(servers)) {
        if (this.isValidConfig(config)) {
          target[name] = config as McpServerConfig;
        }
      }
    } catch {
      // Silently skip malformed config files
    }
  }
```

Three configuration sources are read and merged sequentially; same-name servers are overridden by later reads. The `raw.mcpServers || raw` line handles two formats: the nested `mcpServers` structure in `settings.json` and the flat structure in `.mcp.json`.

#### Connection and Discovery

```typescript
  async loadAndConnect(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.connected) return;  // Idempotent: multiple calls only connect once
    this.connected = true;

    const configs = this.loadConfigs();
    if (Object.keys(configs).length === 0) return;

    const TIMEOUT_MS = 15_000;

    for (const [name, config] of Object.entries(configs)) {
      const conn = new McpConnection(name, config);
      try {
        await conn.connect();
        // Both handshake and tool discovery have 15-second timeouts
        await Promise.race([
          conn.initialize(),
          new Promise((_, rej) => setTimeout(() => rej(new Error("timeout")), TIMEOUT_MS)),
        ]);
        const serverTools = await Promise.race([
          conn.listTools(),
          new Promise<McpToolInfo[]>((_, rej) => setTimeout(() => rej(new Error("timeout")), TIMEOUT_MS)),
        ]);
        this.connections.set(name, conn);
        this.tools.push(...serverTools);
        console.error(`[mcp] Connected to '${name}' — ${serverTools.length} tools`);
      } catch (err: any) {
        console.error(`[mcp] Failed to connect to '${name}': ${err.message}`);
        conn.close();  // Clean up failed connections immediately; don't affect other servers
      }
    }
  }
```

`Promise.race` combined with `setTimeout` implements timeouts. Why 15 seconds? MCP servers often start via `npx`, which needs to download packages on first run, but we shouldn't wait forever. Each server connects independently; one failure doesn't affect others.

#### Tool Definition Conversion

```typescript
  getToolDefinitions(): Array<{ name: string; description: string; input_schema: any }> {
    return this.tools.map((t) => ({
      name: `mcp__${t.serverName}__${t.name}`,
      description: t.description || `MCP tool ${t.name} from ${t.serverName}`,
      input_schema: t.inputSchema || { type: "object", properties: {} },
    }));
  }
```

The key operation: converting raw MCP tool names into three-segment prefixed names. The `filesystem` server's `read_file` tool becomes `mcp__filesystem__read_file`. The returned format directly conforms to the Anthropic API's tool definition spec and can be concatenated directly onto the tool list.

#### Routing and Invocation

```typescript
  isMcpTool(name: string): boolean {
    return name.startsWith("mcp__");
  }

  async callTool(prefixedName: string, args: any): Promise<string> {
    // mcp__serverName__toolName → serverName, toolName
    const parts = prefixedName.split("__");
    if (parts.length < 3) throw new Error(`Invalid MCP tool name: ${prefixedName}`);
    const serverName = parts[1];
    const toolName = parts.slice(2).join("__");  // Tool name might contain __
    const conn = this.connections.get(serverName);
    if (!conn) throw new Error(`MCP server '${serverName}' not connected`);
    return conn.callTool(toolName, args);
  }
```

The routing logic is very concise: extract the server name and tool name from the prefixed name, find the corresponding connection, and forward the call. `parts.slice(2).join("__")` handles the case where the tool name itself might contain `__` (rare, but the protocol doesn't prohibit it).

### 3. Agent Integration

MCP's impact on the Agent Loop is minimal -- only two changes.

#### Lazy Loading on First Chat

```typescript
// agent.ts — beginning of chat() method
if (!this.mcpInitialized && !this.isSubAgent) {
  this.mcpInitialized = true;
  try {
    await this.mcpManager.loadAndConnect();
    const mcpDefs = this.mcpManager.getToolDefinitions();
    if (mcpDefs.length > 0) {
      this.tools = [...this.tools, ...mcpDefs as ToolDef[]];
    }
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error(`[mcp] Init failed: ${err.message}`);
  }
}
```

Three design decisions:

1. **Lazy loading** (on first chat, not in the constructor): The user might just want to ask a quick question and doesn't need to pay the MCP connection startup cost
2. **Only load in the main Agent**: Sub-agents inherit the main Agent's tool list and don't need to reconnect
3. **Failure doesn't crash**: MCP connection failures only produce log output; the Agent continues working with built-in tools

#### Tool Call Routing

```typescript
// agent.ts — executeToolCall() method
private async executeToolCall(name: string, input: Record<string, any>): Promise<string> {
  if (name === "enter_plan_mode" || name === "exit_plan_mode") return await this.executePlanModeTool(name);
  if (name === "agent") return this.executeAgentTool(input);
  if (name === "skill") return this.executeSkillTool(input);
  // MCP tools: prefix match, forward to McpManager
  if (this.mcpManager.isMcpTool(name)) return this.mcpManager.callTool(name, input);
  return executeTool(name, input, this.readFileState);
}
```

One `if` check, one forwarding call. MCP tools are completely transparent to the Agent Loop -- the model sees `mcp__filesystem__read_file`, issues a tool_use call, gets a text result back, with absolutely no difference from built-in tools.

## Key Design Decisions

### Why JSON-RPC over stdio Instead of HTTP?

The advantage of stdio is **zero configuration**: no port management needed, no service discovery, and the process lifecycle is automatically tied to the parent process. When the child process exits, all pending requests are automatically rejected -- no connection leaks. An HTTP approach would need to handle port conflicts, process discovery, and heartbeat detection -- an order of magnitude more complex.

### Why Three-Segment Prefixed Names (`mcp__server__tool`)?

One name solves two problems simultaneously: **avoiding conflicts** (different servers may have same-named tools) and **embedding routing information** (the server name is extracted directly from the name, with no need for an additional mapping table). Claude Code uses the exact same naming scheme.

### Why a 15-Second Timeout?

MCP servers often start via `npx`, which needs to download npm packages on first run, typically taking 3-8 seconds. 15 seconds is enough to cover most cases without making users wait too long. After a timeout, the server is silently skipped, and the Agent continues working with other available tools.

### Why Lazy Connection (on First Chat Rather Than Startup)?

A user might start the Agent just to ask "what does this function mean?" without needing MCP tools at all. Lazy connection makes this scenario zero-overhead. The trade-off is a few seconds of delay the first time an MCP tool is needed, but this only happens once.

### Why Not Use the MCP SDK?

`@anthropic-ai/sdk` provides an MCP client wrapper, but using raw JSON-RPC directly has two benefits: **zero dependencies** (no added package size) and **educational value** (readers can see the complete protocol details and understand what MCP is actually doing). The entire JSON-RPC communication is only ~60 lines of code, simple enough.

## Simplification Comparison

| Dimension | Claude Code | mini-claude |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| MCP SDK | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` built-in client | Raw JSON-RPC (no SDK dependency) |
| Server protocol | stdio + SSE | stdio only |
| Tool discovery | Dynamic refresh (server can notify of changes) | One-time discovery |
| Config sources | settings.json + .mcp.json + enterprise policy | settings.json + .mcp.json |
| Error handling | Retry + fallback | Silently skip failed servers |
| Connection timing | Lazy load on first chat | Lazy load on first chat |
| Sub-agent support | Independent MCP connections | Main Agent only; sub-agents don't connect |
